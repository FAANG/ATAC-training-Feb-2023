# FAANG ATAC-seq Training 01/02/2023

## Setup

This bundle of code and data can be downloaded using the button on the
top right, either through git at the command line, or as a zip (which
then needs to be extracted).

This tutorial uses R and Bioconductor. If you don't have R installed,
or you've never used it before, help is available 
[here](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/). I would recommend
using Rstudio to run this tutorial. More information about Bioconductor
is available [on their website](https://bioconductor.org/).

## Dependencies

First, you should install all of the packages in the 'dependencies.R' file.
This requires you to install the Bioconductor package manager if you don't
have it already, there is a line you can uncomment to do this. This might
take a bit of time on a fresh R install, as R packages tend to
bring in a lot of heavy dependencies.

## Running the tutorial

You should now be able to open the `notebook.Rmd` file in Rstudio and run it
through without any problems. You should have my email address if anything 
does go wrong.
